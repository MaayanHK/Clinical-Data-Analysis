# Clinical data analysis - preterm births
In 2011 I submitted my thesis on the relations between premature birth and key contributing factors. SPSS was the main tool used for data analysis. 
After my recent Data Analyst training I decided to revisit my thesis with a modern tool set.
This repository includes the following:
- Excel sheet with the research data and my recent analysis
- A report summarizing my analysis of the data using Excel
