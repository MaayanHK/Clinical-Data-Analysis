Preterm births data analysis

In 2011 I submitted my thesis on the relations between premature birth and key contributing factors. SPSS was the main tool used for data analysis. 
In 2022 I took a course in modern data analysis which included tools such as Excel, Python, SQL and Power BI. After the course I decided to revisit my thesis with this modern tool set.
This report explores the use of Excel for running key analyses from my thesis.
